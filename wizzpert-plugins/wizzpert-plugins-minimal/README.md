### Developer note

When copying this directory over to create a new `wizzpert-plugins` package, make sure it's nested within the `wizzpert-plugins` folder and that the `"name"` field in `package.json` follows the proper naming convention for CI:

```json
{
  "name": "wizzpert-plugins-<name>",
  "private": true
}
```
